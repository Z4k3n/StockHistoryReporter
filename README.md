# StockHistoryReporter
A simple python program that uses GUI, pandas and quantstats to generate a full company report.

With an input of an initial inversion, you can look how much your capital would have increased/decreased.

## Observations
I coded it so it saves the files on it's proper folder, if you don't want to use them or want to rename the folder you may want to modify the python script aswell.
